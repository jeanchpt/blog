# Personal Blog

## AstroPaper

This website has been developed using AstroPaper.

AstroPaper is a minimal, responsive, accessible and SEO-friendly Astro blog theme. This theme is designed and crafted based on [my personal blog](https://satnaing.dev/blog).

This theme follows best practices and provides accessibility out of the box. Light and dark mode are supported by default. Moreover, additional color schemes can also be configured.

This theme is self-documented \_ which means articles/posts in this theme can also be considered as documentations. Read [the blog posts](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/posts/) or check [the README Documentation Section](#-documentation) for more info.

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All blog posts are stored in `src/content/blog` directory.
